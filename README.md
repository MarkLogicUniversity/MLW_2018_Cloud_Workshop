# Hands-On Technical Workshop: Learn How to Deploy on the Cloud (AWS & Azure)

Learn about deploying MarkLogic on two of the most popular cloud technologies: Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

## AWS Overview

Did you know MarkLogic’s first cloud customer went live on AWS in 2009? Our team has more experience with NoSQL in the cloud than anyone else, and we want to share our best practices with you! In this workshop, we’ll jump start your journey for deploying MarkLogic on AWS. We’ll walk you through basic concepts for cloud deployments and the justifications for key decisions. We’ll also walk through the tools and guidance that make MarkLogic AWS deployments fast and easy, including how to use the AWS Cloud Formation Template, understanding AWS concepts such as VPC and Cloud Watch, and best practices for security. For those advanced users attending, you’ll get a taste of how to customize and extend your deployment based on the examples we provide.

-	In the first part, we will create a MarkLogic 3-server cluster in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud using a Cloud Formation Template. We'll cover the Cloud Formation Template architecture and the Amazon resources create such as EC2 instances, volumes and network interfaces.
-	In the second part, we will examine MarkLogic server recovery. We will halt one of the MarkLogic servers in the cloud, examine the effects of a missing MarkLogic node on the cluster and the recovery to restore the cluster.
- In the optional third part, we will use the Cloud Formation Template to pause then resume the cluster. Pausing clusters greatly reduces the cost of Amazon resources and helpful for intermittent usage such as QA environments.

## Azure Overview

Microsoft Azure is a growing collection of integrated cloud services for building, deploying, and managing applications through a global network of data centers in over 40 regions—more than any other cloud provider. In this workshop, we’ll jump start your journey for deploying MarkLogic on the Azure platform. We will walk you through basic concepts and offerings that MarkLogic and Azure provide. For example, we’ll discuss Azure Solution Templates, Virtual Networks, and Availability Sets. We’ll also give you a hands-on opportunity to deploy a MarkLogic cluster on Azure in just a few clicks. For those advanced users attending, you’ll get a taste of how to customize and extend your deployment based on the examples we provide.

-	In the first part, we will deploy MarkLogic to the Azure cloud.
-	In the second part, we will scale up the number of MarkLogic nodes.
- In the optional third part, examine how MarkLogic Server nodes recover from failures in the Azure cloud.
